# IC 10 source for the game Stationeers

This contains varying quality of IC10 code that I have created for the game [Stationeers](https://store.steampowered.com/app/544550/Stationeers/).  They probably mostly not very re-usable on their own, without modifications, but if you some how happen on here, good luck and you are welcome to use any of them.  I keep telling myself, I
will only write simple code, and won't make too complex of control code for this game, but some of them ends up pretty complex.

I mostly play multiplayer with a couple of friends.  And none of us are this type of engineer, so the game has been decently complex for us.

In these scripts; VC just stand for our vulcan play through.  IC is IC chips
