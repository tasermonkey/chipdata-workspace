# Furnance Control Scripts

## Arc Furnace Control script
- Just create a seperate room for the arc furnaces (no door required)
- A Active Vent that sucks out its air
- [This chip](./VC%20IC%20-%20Arc%20Furnace.ic10)
  - Configure the `d?` to be the arc furnaces
  - This will make it so that when items reaches the furnace it will auto turn on.
  - It turns off furances that are idle
  - Best to use with a chute system.
  - Even better with full stacks, but that isn't required.
